...he's the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So, we'll hunt him, because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a silent guardian. A watchful protector. A Dark Knight.
People need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy, and I can't do that as Bruce Wayne. As a man, I'm flesh and blood; I can be ignored, I can be destroyed. But as a symbol... as a symbol I can be incorruptible. I can be everlasting.
A hero can be anyone. Even a man doing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy's shoulders to let him know that the world hadn't ended.
Yeah, I mean, just gotta play our game out there and keep it simple. Can't take these guys lightly, gotta play a full 60. Get pucks to the net with bodies in front. Good group o' guys in here gettin' pucks in deep, sacrificing the body. Need to come out with 2 points.
Regardless of how you feel inside, always try to look like a winner. Even if you are behind, a sustained look of control and confidence can give you a mental edge that results in victory.
